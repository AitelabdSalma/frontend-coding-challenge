## Idea of the App 
The main idea is to implement a small webapp that will list the most starred Github repos that were created in the last 30 days. 
You'll be fetching the sorted JSON data directly from the Github API (Github API explained down below). 

## Features
* As a User I should be able to list the most starred Github repos that were created in the last 30 days. 
* As a User I should see the results as a list. One repository per row. 
* As a User I should be able to see for each repo/row the following details :
  * Repository name
  * Repository description 
  * Number of stars for the repo. 
  * Number of issues for the repo.
  * Username and avatar of the owner. 
* As a User I should be able to keep scrolling and new results should appear (pagination).

## How to submit the challenge solution? 
Now after you finished your app and we assume that you already pushed it to your GitHub account, if so please follow the instructions below:

1. Set the Repo privacy:
   - If the repo is sensitive and you're not comfortable sharing it publicly please give access to this username: [salimbraksa](https://github.com/salimbraksa).
   - If it's public go to the next step
2. Send the repo's link to this email: `careers@gemography.com`.
